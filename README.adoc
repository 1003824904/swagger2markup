= swagger2AsciiDoc
This project is a Swagger to AsciiDoc converter. It takes an swagger.json or swagger.yaml as an input file 
and generates an AsciiDoc file. 
The primary goal of this project is to simplify the documentation of RESTful APIs. The result is intended to 
be an easy-to-read, on- and offline user guide, akin to GitHub's API documentation for example.

You could generate your AsciiDoc documentation using Spring Boot and swagger-springmvc as follows:

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@SpringApplicationConfiguration(classes = SpringBootSwaggerConfig.class)
@IntegrationTest
@WebAppConfiguration
public class Swagger2AsciiDocTest {

    @Test
    public void convertSwaggerToAsciiDoc() {
        Swagger2AsciiDocConverter.newInstance("http://localhost:8080/api-docs", "src/docs/asciidoc/example.adoc").convertSwagger2AsciiDoc();
    }

}
----

You can then generate HTML5 and PDF documentation via Asciidoctorj or even better via the asciidoctor-gradle-plugin.
